# Sample Markdown for Testing

This is a sample markdown file to test the import functionality of our Tiptap editor.

## Features

Here's a list of markdown features we're testing:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- ~~Strikethrough text~~
- [Links to websites](https://example.com)

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

Inline `code` is also supported.

### Tables

| Name     | Role       | Department   |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| John Doe | Developer  | Engineering  |
| Jane Smith | Designer   | Design       |
| Mike Johnson | Manager    | Operations   |

### Task Lists

- [x] Implement Markdown export
- [x] Implement toolbar with icons

## Conclusion

If all these elements import correctly, then our markdown importer is working properly!
